## 🧠 About the Author

**Nirajan Ghimire** is a passionate self-taught coder, web developer, and IoT enthusiast.  
His journey began at the age of 13 when he built his first website — a moment that sparked a lifelong love for creation through technology.  

With hands-on expertise in **C**, **PHP**, **jQuery**, **Python**, and full-stack development, Nirajan has cultivated a deep understanding of how design, logic, and curiosity come together to create meaningful solutions.  

As the founder of **Sathi Language**, he aims to make coding feel less mechanical and more emotional — a conversation rather than a command.

> “Technology should not erase identity; it should echo it.”
