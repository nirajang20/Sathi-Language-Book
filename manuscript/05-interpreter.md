## 🧠 Introduction

Most people see an interpreter as a technical component — a system that reads, parses, and executes code.  
But to me, an interpreter is **a translator of thought**.  

When I designed the **Sathi Interpreter**, I didn’t just want it to process commands.  
I wanted it to **understand** — to read words that carry emotion, identity, and purpose.  
The interpreter, in that sense, became more than a piece of software; it became a **listener of culture**.

This chapter reveals how Sathi turns human-friendly words into machine-executable logic,  
bridging two worlds — one of emotion, and one of computation.

## ⚙️ Overview: How Sathi Thinks

Before diving into the inner workings, let’s visualize what happens when you type:

```sathi
sathi bhanna "Sathi!"
```

The process looks like this:

1. **Tokenizer** — breaks the sentence into tokens (words, numbers, symbols).  
2. **Parser** — organizes tokens into structure and meaning.  
3. **Executor** — performs the action the structure represents.  

You speak.  
Sathi listens.  
Then it responds.

## 🧩 The Tokenizer — Hearing Words Clearly

The **Tokenizer** (or *Lexer*) is the interpreter’s first ear.  
It scans through each line of code and identifies the meaningful components called **tokens**.

In Python terms:

```python
class SathiTokenizer:
    def __init__(self, code):
        self.code = code.split("\n")

    def tokenize(self):
        tokens = []
        for line in self.code:
            words = line.strip().split()
            tokens.append(words)
        return tokens
```

If your Sathi program is:

```sathi
sathi yo ho naam = "Nirajan"
sathi bhanna "Namaste, " + naam
```

Then the tokenizer converts it into:

```
[['sathi', 'yo', 'ho', 'naam', '=', '"Nirajan"'],
 ['sathi', 'bhanna', '"Namaste,', '"+', 'naam']]
```

Each word has weight.  
For the interpreter, these are not just strings — they’re **expressions of intent**.

> 🪶 “Tokenization is like language listening — you don’t just hear sounds; you recognize meaning.”

---

## 🧭 The Parser — Finding Meaning in Structure

Once tokens are identified, the **Parser** takes over.  
Its job is to make sense of what’s being said — just as humans interpret tone and grammar.

In Sathi, a parser must understand:

- When a variable is being declared (`sathi yo ho naam = ...`)  
- When something should be printed (`sathi bhanna ...`)  
- When logic should flow conditionally (`sathi yedi ... bhane`)  
- When repetition occurs (`sathi dohoryau ...`)  
- And when a conversation ends (`sathi sakkyo`)

Simplified implementation:

```python
class SathiParser:
    def __init__(self, tokens):
        self.tokens = tokens

    def parse(self):
        for line in self.tokens:
            if line[1] == "bhanna":
                expression = " ".join(line[2:])
                print(eval(expression))
            elif line[1] == "yo" and line[2] == "ho":
                var_name = line[3]
                value = eval(" ".join(line[5:]))
                globals()[var_name] = value
```

The parser doesn’t just check syntax; it **interprets intent**.  
It recognizes that *bhanna* means “to say,” and that *yo ho* introduces identity.

> “Parsing is where the heart meets logic — the moment words start to mean something.”

## 🧮 Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) — The Structure of Thought

The **Abstract Syntax Tree** (AST) is like the skeleton of a conversation.  
It captures the hierarchy — who said what, and in what context.

For example, this code:

```sathi
sathi yedi x > y bhane
    sathi bhanna "X thulo chha"
sathi natra
    sathi bhanna "Y thulo chha"
sathi sakkyo
```

Might be represented internally as:

```
IfStatement
 ├── Condition: x > y
 ├── TrueBranch: print("X thulo chha")
 └── FalseBranch: print("Y thulo chha")
```

Each node in the AST mirrors a thought in the programmer’s mind.  
That’s why I like to think of the AST as *“a structured diary of intentions.”*

---

## ⚡ The Executor — Acting with Understanding

Once meaning is derived, the **Executor** performs the corresponding action.  
It doesn’t just run code — it fulfills intention.

Simplified version:

```python
class SathiExecutor:
    def __init__(self, tree):
        self.tree = tree

    def execute(self):
        for node in self.tree:
            if node["type"] == "print":
                print(node["value"])
            elif node["type"] == "assignment":
                globals()[node["var"]] = node["value"]
```

Each execution step in Sathi is designed to **acknowledge the human** behind the code.  
That’s why error messages, outputs, and interactions are framed with empathy — not harshness.

---

## 💬 Example: The Full Cycle

Let’s walk through a complete example:

```sathi
sathi yo ho naam = "Nirajan"
sathi bhanna "Sathi, " + naam + "!"
```

1. **Tokenizer:** Recognizes tokens  
   → `['sathi', 'yo', 'ho', 'naam', '=', '"Nirajan"']`  
   → `['sathi', 'bhanna', '"Sathi,', '"+', 'naam', '+"!"']`

2. **Parser:** Understands the intent  
   - First line → variable creation  
   - Second line → print statement  

3. **AST:**  
   ```
   [ 
     { type: "assignment", var: "naam", value: "Nirajan" },
     { type: "print", value: "Sathi, Nirajan!" }
   ]
   ```

4. **Executor:** Outputs  
   ```
   Sathi, Nirajan!
   ```

The cycle from text to execution feels like a dialogue —  
a *friend listening, understanding, and responding.*

## 🧠 Error Handling — When Misunderstandings Happen

No friendship is perfect.  
Sometimes, we say something the interpreter can’t understand — a missing space, a forgotten `sakkyo`.

Instead of cold, cryptic messages, Sathi aims for clarity and kindness.

Example:

```bash
❌ Sathi samjhana sakena: syntax error line 2
💡 Suggestion: Check if you missed ‘sathi sakkyo’
```

These messages are crafted to **teach, not punish** — because learning should feel encouraging, not intimidating.

> “Every error is a chance to explain better — not to make someone feel smaller.”

## 🧬 Architecture Overview

The Sathi Interpreter is written in **Python**, using object-oriented structure for modularity.  
Here’s a conceptual overview:

```
/sathi-lang/
│
├── sathi.py             # Main entry point
├── interpreter.py       # Core interpreter logic
├── tokenizer.py         # Breaks code into tokens
├── parser.py            # Converts tokens into AST
├── executor.py          # Executes AST nodes
└── helpers/
    ├── utils.py
    ├── error_messages.py
    └── keywords.json
```

This modular design allows Sathi to evolve gracefully —  
making it easier to add new features like file imports, AI suggestions, or interactive debugging.

## 🪴 Design Philosophy: Interpreter as a Listener

Traditional interpreters enforce strict rules.  
But Sathi’s interpreter listens first, interprets second, and executes third.  
It models human communication — **hear → understand → respond.**

When someone speaks in broken grammar, we don’t crash. We infer meaning.  
That’s how Sathi treats users too.

> “In programming, empathy should be a compiler feature.”  
> — *Nirajan Ghimire*

## 💫 Future Vision: Intelligent Interpretation

The long-term goal is to merge **AI-driven intent parsing** with the Sathi Interpreter.  
Imagine writing:

```sathi
sathi soch "Banau ek calculator jun add garos ra subtract garos"
```

And the interpreter dynamically generating logic for it.

This blend of **natural language understanding** and **cultural linguistics**  
will create the next generation of *empathetic compilers* — systems that understand not just what you say, but *why you say it.*

---

## 🪶 Summary

The Sathi Interpreter is not a machine that executes — it’s a friend that understands.  
It reads words like *bhanna* and *sakkyo* and finds meaning in them,  
turning cultural communication into logical precision.

From tokenization to execution, every step mirrors human dialogue —  
listening, processing, and responding with empathy.
